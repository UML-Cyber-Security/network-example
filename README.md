# Network Example for COMP 3611 Project (Milestone 4)

## 1. Change file permissions

In order to run the files from the command line, you need to use the 'chmod' program to change permissions to executable. This may or may not be set when you clone this repository.

```
network-example $ chmod +x basic_cert.sh 
network-example $ chmod +x network.py 
```

## 2. Create certificate

When prompted, please fill in the information fields. This script will create 'cert.pem'. Read more about certificates [here](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html).

**Notice: Common name needs to be 'test.server' if you are using this example.**

```
network-example $ ./basic_cert.sh
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
...........................+++
.........+++
writing new private key to 'cert.pem'
-----
...
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:Massachusetts
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Lowell
Organization Name (eg, company) []:UML
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:100
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:test.server
Email Address []:server@gmail.com
```

## 3. Running program

Run this in a seperate terminal. This will start the program on port 53950.

```
network-example $ ./network.py
Starting: broadcast_listener_worker
Starting: broadcast_sender_worker
Starting: tcp_listener_worker
(b'bcast_test: 0', ('10.0.0.10', 53950))
```

Run this in another terminal while the first one is running. This will start the program on port 51500.

**Notice: there is a command line argument for the program. It can be any string.**

```
network-example $ ./network.py anything
Starting: broadcast_listener_worker
Starting: broadcast_sender_worker
Starting: tcp_listener_worker
(b'bcast_test: 0', ('10.0.0.10', 51500))
```

## 4. Sending message

Type in the terminal window while the program is running to send a message.

```
...
test_message
Bytes Sent:     test_message
Bytes Received: ACK from server
...

(In other terminal)
Echoing message from: 127.0.0.1
b'test_message'
```

```
...
heythere
Bytes Sent:     heythere
Bytes Received: ACK from server
...

(In other terminal)
Echoing message from: 127.0.0.1
b'heythere'
```

## 5. Close program with 'CTRL + C'

```
^C
Terminating: broadcast_listener_worker
listener shutting down
None
Terminating: broadcast_sender_worker
None
Terminating: tcp_listener_worker
None
network-example $
```
